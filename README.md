## Pt.3 - Check Your Understanding

1) I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. The message feature involves multiple components working together such as the text input, message formatting, backend delivery, and user interface updates. Unit tests cannot test multiple components together, which is why I would not use it to test the "message" feature. 
2) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application, since it doens't rely on other components than itself. All the unit test is checking for is if the message the user is writing is less than 80 characters, which can easily be implemented. Therefore, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application.
